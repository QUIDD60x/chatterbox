Great question! People use a mental abacus by visualizing the beads on a traditional abacus. They picture moving the beads mentally to perform calculations. Each position represents a value, and users practice to quickly add, subtract, multiply, or divide just by imagining those movements in their mind! It's all about using that amazing brain power!

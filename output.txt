Hi there! The main difference is that Arduino is a platform for building microcontroller projects, while the ESP32 is a specific microcontroller on that platform. The ESP32 has built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, making it ideal for IoT projects, whereas many Arduino boards may need extra components for wireless connectivity. Basically, ESP32 is like an Arduino on turbo with added features!
